PROBLEM DEFINITION
Suppose we went to the museum or art gallery there we found something which we really 
want to purchase so for that we need to contact to the manager and talk to him to get aware 
about the procedure of purchasing, but at the last moment, we come to know that someone 
has already booked that painting or art there we feel helpless because that painting was on

distance you need to cover from your home to art gallery.
